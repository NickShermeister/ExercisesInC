2) Use the Makefile to compile the program and run it. Do any syncronization errors occur?
A: There were 123121 errors in my test run of counter_array.

3) Compile, run, and confirm that there are no errors now.
A: done

4) Synchronization takes some time. Comment out the print statements in counter_array.c and counter_array_mutex.c, then recompile and time them. How much overhead is imposed:

counter_array overhead imposed:
real	0m0.053s
user	0m0.059s
sys	0m0.C013s

counter_array_mutex overhead imposed:
real	0m0.179s
user	0m0.175s
sys	0m0.151s

Overall, there is a change from 0.125s to 0.505s or approximately a 4x increase in time when using mutex. It imposes the most overhead on the system, with a 11x increase in time when compared to the 3x increase in time for real and user.
